First of all I would like to thank Professor Daniel Favrat who has
supported me unconditionally throughout the whole thesis time. I
particularly appreciated his guidance and vision. I also address my
gratitude toward Professor Jürg Schiffmann who supported me in this
project with lots of inestimable advice and care on theoretical and
technical topics. I am also grateful that he accepted to be one of the
co-examiners for this thesis. My thanks equally go to Professor
Vincent Lemort and Dr. David Hughes for having accepted to be
co-examiners for this thesis, and to Professor Jan Van Herle to have
accepted to be the President of the jury. Many thanks to my colleagues
Julien Jakubowski and Johannes Wegele who have greatly contributed to
the success of this project with their help in the laboratory.

During my work and my research at LENI, there were many people who
have made my work considerably easier and more enjoyable. Particular
thanks to Johannes, Samuel, Matthias, Jonathan, Nicolas B., Leandro,
Emanuela, Samira, Nasibeh, Thierry, Emmanuele, Hossein, Zlatina,
Germain, Stefano, Alberto, Jakob, Nicolas D., Stefan, Arata, Raffaele,
Zacharie, Léonidas, Tivi, Leda, Raman, Priscilla, Luc, Hélène,
Stéphane, and Laurence. Thanks to them for sharing many ideas and good
times. I also thank Dr. Michele Zehnder for the interesting
discussions about heat pumps that we have had each time we met. I also
want to thank my colleagues and friends from LTCM and LTT who have
shared with me nice and sweet moments, in addition to their experience
with experimental work. My thanks go notably, in LTCM, to Ricardo,
Gustavo, Nicolas L., Eugene, Duan, Marco, Mirco, Sylwia, Sepideh,
Etienne, Jackson, Brian, Nicolas A., Jeff, Natalie, Cécile, Giulia,
Mathieu, Andrea, and in LTT, to Philip, Sami, Achim, Virginie, Elia,
Jonsson, and Alexandros. Thanks also to the people close and dear to
me who where there to support me so frequently. I met wonderful people
while practicing martial arts, volunteering, or defending the causes
dear to me. Thanks for the wonderful times that helped me and made me
stand the work load.

My special thanks go to Marc Salle, Christophe Zurmühle, Nicolas
Jaunin, Laurent Chevalley, and Aziz, for the help with the
manufacturing of the parts and the assembly of the experimental
setups.

Many thanks to Brigitte, Suzanne, Irène, and Faye, the amazing LENI
secretaries, who always made things easy with the administrative stuff
and who saved the situation many times, despite the tight schedule.

Many thanks to my first aider teammates and friends, notably to Eric,
Pierre-Alain, Andrey, Suzanne, Andreas, Nils, Coralie, Pauline,

Alok, Elise, Frank, Julien, Christophe, and Pascal for the nice
moments during the EPFL events and for really interesting exchanges
and discussions. Many thanks to the DSPS for its top-level
first-aider-training program.

My deepest thanks go to you, Alisa, who always supported me and the
constraints subsequent to our lives. You have stood unacceptable
situations and difficulties, and you have helped me to evolve and
grow. For this, I will never thank you enough. Thank you, Riwen, to
have been such a patient, understanding, and tolerant child with
me. Thanks to have been so frequently nice when I was falling asleep
directly on the ground of your room, while we were playing, when I was
finally back home after long work days. Thanks to you,

amazing songs, optimist and cheerful melodies and lyrics, which guided
me through my thesis work and efforts, and which still guide me
through my life. Thanks to you,
