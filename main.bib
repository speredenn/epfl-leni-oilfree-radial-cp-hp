  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the global modelling and the
 predictive functional control (PFC) of a tubular counter
 current heat exchanger. The hot product flowing through the
 inner tube is cooled and its outlet temperature is
 monitored under varying the flow rate of cold fluid
 circulating in the annular duct. A global model
 representing the response to inlet temperature variations
 is used to implement the \{PFC\} algorithm. The control law
 takes into account the convexity property of the heat
 exchanger, which distinguishes the linear effects of state
 perturbations from the non-linear effects of structure
 disturbances. The control equation corresponds to a generic
 algebraic solver, which enables to assess the inlet
 temperature or the flow rate of cold fluid. In this study,
 the manipulated variable used to control the heat exchanger
 is the flow rate of cold fluid corresponding to a parameter
 of the dynamic model while the inlet temperature, which is
 the principal input, is kept constant. The \{PFC\}
 algorithm is then "parametric" and the manipulated
 parameter is derived from the control equation. The
 robustness of this controller has also been studied when
 inlet temperatures and flow rate of product are subjected
 to sudden fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive review of flow boiling characteristics and
 flow pattern visualization of refrigerant/lubricant oil
 mixtures is presented in this paper. First, various
 parameters influenced by the lubricant oil in convective
 boiling of refrigerants, such as mass velocity, vapor
 quality, oil concentration and geometric characteristics of
 the heat transfer tube are discussed. The effects of the
 unavoidable introduction of the lubricant oil on the
 thermodynamics properties of a refrigerant are described.
 Then, a review of the main experimental studies of flow
 boiling of refrigerant/lubricant oil mixtures is presented
 and also describes research with halocarbons, carbon
 dioxide, hydrocarbons and ammonia. There is no agreement
 among these studies regarding the effect of the oil in the
 evaporator, with studies showing an increase or decrease in
 the heat transfer coefficient. However, in relation to
 pressure drop, all the results presented the same trend,
 increasing the pressure drop with increasing oil
 concentration. Next, the flow patterns of refrigerant/oil
 mixtures are illustrated together with a selection of video
 images. It is possible to notice the difference in frothing
 formation with respect to the particular refrigerant and
 tube geometry. Some predictions of oil effects on the heat
 transfer coefficient and pressure drops based on the
 mixture physical properties are then presented and the
 trends compared to data. Finally, some suggestions for
 future work are given. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All

  Abstract                 = {An overview of options and potential barriers and risks for reducing the energy consumption, peak demand, and emissions for seven key energy consuming residential products (refrigerator-freezers, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, electric ovens, gas ovens and microwave ovens) is presented. The paper primarily concentrates on the potential energy savings from the use of advanced technologies in appliances for the U.S. market. The significance and usefulness of each technology was evaluated in order to prioritize the R&amp;D needs to improve energy efficiency of appliances in view of energy savings, cost, and complexity. The paper provides a snapshot of the future R&amp;D needs for each of the technologies along with the associated barriers. Although significant energy savings may be achieved, one of the major barriers in most cases is high first cost. One way of addressing this issue and promoting the introduction of new technologies is to "level" the playing field for all manufacturers by establishing Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) which are not cost prohibitive and promoting energy efficient products through incentives to both manufacturers and consumers.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this work, a novel and robust solution
 approach is presented that can be used to predict the
 steady-state thermal heat transfer rate for counterflow
 heat exchangers with any combination of single-phase and
 two-phase conditions within the heat exchanger. This
 methodology allows for multiple internal pinching points,
 as well as all permutations of subcooled liquid, two-phase
 and superheated vapor sections for the hot and cold fluids.
 A residual function based on the matching of the required
 and available thermal conductances in each section is
 derived, and Brent's method is then used to drive the
 residual to zero. Examples are presented for the
 application of this methodology to a water-heated n-Propane
 evaporator. The computational time required to execute the
 model for a simple case is on the order of one millisecond
 when the tabular interpolation methods of CoolProp are
 applied. Source code for the algorithm is provided in the
 Python programming language as an appendix. },

  Abstract                 = {The fins of air-cooled evaporators freeze at evaporating
 temperatures below 0°C. Air-water-heat-pumps are concerned
 with this problem, which causes a drop in heating
 performance. In addition the evaporator must be
 periodically defrosted. The subject of defrosting has been
 theoretically investigated in the first stage of this
 Project. In the second stage of the project, described
 here, the data of 7 heatpumps with hot gas defrosting and 6
 heatpumps with reversed-cycle defrosting were analysed. The
 analysis of the reversed-cycle defrosting has shown that
 the defrosting energy consists not only of the electrical
 energy for defrosting, but also of indirect energy losses.
 These are a) the electrical energy to compensate the heat
 extraction of the heating system during defrosting and b)
 the losses because of the 4- way reversing valve (leakage
 and heat exchange from the pressure side to the suction
 side and also a drop in pressure). The effects of the
 reversing valve are only small, but they add up because
 they have an effect during the whole heating cycle. The
 natural defrosting during longer shut-off periods with
 source tempera- tures above 0°C is also taken into
 account. The results show that reversed cycle defrosting
 uses only about 30% of the electrical defrosting energy
 during the defrosting cycle, 50% is used for the
 compensation of the extracted heat of the heating system
 and 20% for the losses of the 4-way reversing valve. At low
 water temperatures (35°C) hot gas defrosting needs more
 electrical energy for defrosting than systems with reversed
 cycle defrosting. At higher water temperatures (50°C) the
 defrosting energy consumption of both systems is equal. On
 average, systems with hot gas defrosting need 2.3kWh
 electrical energy for 100kWh effective heat, and
 reversed-cycle sys- tems need 2.1kWh. The investigation of
 alternative defrosting systems and the effect},

 The paper reports measurements of heat transfer
 coefficients in convective condensation of R22, both
 oil-free and with three concentrations of Shell Clavus 32
 oil. A 3/8 in outer diameter copper tube (8.05 mm inner
 diameter), 1.8 m long, was used at condensation
 temperatures of 40 and 50-degrees-C. Heat flux and mixture
 mass velocity were kept constant at 2500 W/m2 and 155
 kg/m2s, respectively, and measured coefficients were in the
 range 1350-2850 W/m2 K. Results showed that the heat
 transfer coefficient is reduced nonlinearly by the presence
 of oil, the reduction reaching 25\% when the oil
 concentration is 5\% by mass, and 28\% at an oil
 concentration of 10\%. An assessment showed that the effect
 of this reduction in the condensation heat transfer
 coefficient on the predicted performance of a heat pump is
 small. A new correlation is presented for the heat transfer
 coefficient in convective condensation of refrigerant-oil
 mixtures, which predicts the results of the present study
 to within approximately +/- 18\%. The correlation is
 compared with those given by Tichy et al. and Shah.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, one of the main alternatives for a more rational
 use of energy in heating applications is the heat pumping
 technologies. The market is dominated by two kinds of heat
 pump systems: the electrically driven vapor compression
 heat pumps (EHP), which are the most widely used in
 residential heating applications and the thermally driven
 heat pumps (TDHP), that are usually based on a sorption
 process. In this thesis, theoretical and experimental
 investigations of a concept of thermally driven heat pump,
 based on the coupling of a vapor compression heat pump
 cycle and an organic Rankine cycle, are presented. The
 system is named here as ORC-ORC. The studied concept uses a
 single stage centrifugal compressor directly coupled to a
 single stage radial inflow turbine. The shaft is rotating
 on gas bearings, which allows the system to be oil-free.
 Like most of the other TDHP's, this system has the
 advantage to work with a variety of fuels or heat sources
 like wood pellets, natural gas, solar heat, geothermal heat
 or waste heat. The concept studied in this work is a gas
 red system for space heating and domestic hot water
 production in small residential buildings. A systematic
 approach has been used to evaluate, in term of energy
 efficiency, the potential of ORC-ORC systems and to propose
 optimal design specifications at different levels of the
 design process. The method is based on the optimization
 which allows to identify the best configurations at each
 design step with respect to the designer choices. This
 approach is divided in three steps. In the first step, a
 model of the complete system has been developed based on a
 process integration approach. This step allows to quickly
 determine whether the system is potentially attractive or
 not, for given conditions, before going deeper in the
 design process. The results show that, in general, it is
 advantageous for the ORC evaporation to be supercritical.
 In the second step, based on the process integration
 results and heuristic rules, a suitable system heat
 exchanger network has been generated and modeled. The
 predicted values of the coefficient of performance (COP) at
 design conditions, for the different situations, are in the
 range 1.30 and 2.19. In a last step, the off-design
 characteristics of the compressor-turbine unit are
 considered, in order to evaluate the COP as well as the
 heating capacity range that can be covered with a specific
 compressor-turbine unit design. For this purpose, a model
 of the compressor-turbine unit has been developed.
 Experimental investigations have been carried out with
 R134a as working fluid. A first simple test rig has been
 developed to test the selected ORC evaporator in
 supercritical conditions. The measurements have allowed to
 calibrate and to validate an in-house supercritical
 evaporator simulation tool. An ORC-ORC prototype has been
 developed and built. Commercially available equipment has
 been used, except for the compressor-turbine unit that has
 been designed especially for this application. The targeted
 operating point, with an HP evaporation temperature of 0
 °C and a condensing temperature of 35 °C, has not been
 reached, because of experimental difficulties which caused
 some delay. A maximum temperature difference of 20 °C
 between the HP evaporation and the condensation has been
 achieved, which corresponds to a compressor pressure ratio
 of 1.9. Measurements have been performed with
 compressor-turbine unit rotational speeds up to 171 krpm.
 The theoretical investigations shows that the proposed
 ORC-ORC concept is an interesting alternative of thermally
 actuated heating device for small residential buildings.
 Concerning the experimental investigations, although a
 number of problems have been encountered during the tests,
 it has been demonstrated that the proposed concept is
 feasible with today's technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Im Rahmen der systematischen Qualitätssicherungsstrategie
 des Bundesamtes für Energie (BFE) und der
 Fördergemeinschaft Wärmepumpen Schweiz für Wärmepumpen
 bis 60 kW Heizleistung werden Norm- und Feldprüfungen an
 Wärmepumpen durchgeführt. Die Normprüfungen erfolgen
 anhand von international festgelegten Prüfabläufen nach
 EN 14511 oder nach EN 255-3 und werden im
 Wärmepumpen-Testzentrum WPZ in Buchs durchgeführt. Im
 Betriebsjahr 2008 konnten am WPZ Buchs insgesamt 28
 Wärmepumpenprüfungen durchgeführt werden, so viele wie
 nie zuvor. Dies ist auf die gute Auftragslage und eine
 weitere Erhöhung der Prüfkapazitäten durch die
 konsequente Optimierung der Prüfstände zurückzuführen.
 Im Berichtsjahr wurde das Wärmepumpen-Testzentrum WPZ in
 Buchs nach EN 17025 akkreditiert. Die bedeutet, dass der
 Prüfbetrieb nun nicht nur von der Akkreditierungsstelle
 her qualitativ überwacht wird, sondern auch, dass die
 WPZ-Wärmepumpenprüfungen nun international vollständig
 anerkannt werden. Durch den Einsitz in das internationale
 EHPA/DACH Gütesiegel Komitee und die Besetzung des
 Vize-Präsidiums durch das WPZ konnten wichtige Erfahrungen
 in den Aufbau und die Reglementierung dieses Gremiums mit
 eingebracht werden. Die gemessenen COP bei den
 Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpen lagen bei 3 von 5 Wärmepumpen
 unter den in den Vorjahren gemessenen Durchschnittswerten.
 Bei den Sole-Wasser-Wärmepumpen lagen die gemessenen COP
 etwa gleich mit den Mittelwerten aus den Vorjahren, wobei
 es 2 Ausreisser gab. Die Stagnation der energetischen
 Effizienz in den letzten Jahren zeigt, dass der COP bei der
 Entwicklung von Wärmepumpen nicht mehr erste Priorität
 hat. Weitere Auswertungen der am WPZ durchgeführten
 Messungen, zeigen, dass hinsichtlich den Mindest-COP zur
 Erteilung des internationalen EHPA-DACH-Gütesiegels die
 meisten Wärmepumpen die Grenzwerte erreichen; bei den
 Luft-Wasser-Wärmepumpen sind dies 81 % der geprüften
 Geräte, bei den Sole-Wasser-Wärmepumpen 87 % und bei den
 Wasser-Wasser-Wärmepumpen gar 100 % der Geräte. Eine
 eventuelle Entscheidung zur Anhebung des Grenzwertes durch
 die internationale Gütesiegel-Kommission kann auf die hier
 gemachten Häufigkeitsverteilungen der gemessenen COP
 abgestützt werden.},

 extended to regulate the condensing pressure. In order to
 study the influence of this control method on the
 Coefficient of Performance (COP), experiments are conducted
 on a refrigerating machine by changing the cooling capacity
 from 120 to 30 kW. As PFC improves disturbance rejection
 compared to a PID control, it is possible to reduce the
 superheat setting value and to prevent any unevaporated
 refrigerant liquid from reaching the compressor. As a
 consequence the use of PFC leads to an increase of COP
 which depends on operating conditions.},

 makers is still a major challenge. Recently the ``Canton of
 Geneva{''} in Switzerland introduced a new law governing
 the procedures of attribution of building permits for new

 a procedure including the calculation of an exergy
 indicator to be quantified in each file concerning large
 projects submitted for acceptance. This paper summarizes
 the problem definition, a clarification of the limits
 expected from the exergy indicator as well as the
 spreadsheet tool and the tables used to facilitate this
 quantification both for heating and air conditioning. For
 simplification the overall system was divided into a
 superstructure formed by four subsystems including the room
 convector, the plant of the building, a possible district
 heating and cooling plant and an external power plant.
 Three temperature ranges were considered for the building
 distribution networks both in heating and cooling. Ten
 different technology combinations were considered ranking
 from the lowest heating exergy efficiency with nuclear
 electricity and joule heating to the best efficiency with
 hydroelectricity and District heating electric heat pumps

  Abstract                 = {Replacing conventional boilers by air to water heat pumps
 represents a major market opportunity and a contribution to
 more sustainable heating approaches. However, such retrofit
 situation impose tough technical requirements which must be
 met in order to demonstrate reasonable efficiencies at high
 temperature lifts together with a moderate heat rate
 decrease at lower air temperatures. During the last decade
 major improvements in heat exchanger and compressor
 efficiencies have permitted significant COP increase in
 single stage domestic heat pumps, bringing the technology
 to a point where further progress can only be achieved with
 more complex cycles. Two stage cycles common in large heat
 pump or refrigeration systems have not been exploited so
 far in the domestic heat pump range, although they
 potentially meet some of the requirements mentioned above.
 This paper describes the results obtained with a laboratory
 prototype allowing operation with both single and two stage
 with economizer cycles, as well as the speed control of one
 of the two compressors. At A-7/W50 the two stage
 configuration outperformed the single stage by up to 15% in
 terms of COP and up to more than 70% in terms of heat
 supply. Exergetic efficiencies (discounted for fan power
 and defrosting) up to 49% at A-10/W60 have been measured.},

  Abstract                 = {A capillary tube is widely used as an expansion device for
 small refrigeration cycles. In a practical refrigeration
 cycle, some amount of refrigeration oil is discharged from
 a compressor and refrigerant/oil mixture flows through the
 capillary tube. This study investigated experimentally the
 influence of mixing of the refrigeration oil with the
 refrigerant on the flow through the capillary tube. The
 experiments are carried out with not only a miscible
 combination of refrigerant and oil but also an immiscible
 combination. In both cases, the mass flow rate through the
 capillary tube and temperature and pressure distributions
 along the tube are measured under several conditions of
 subcooled degree and oil concentration. In the case of
 miscible combination, the mass flow rate of refrigerant
 decreases with increasing the oil concentration because the
 viscosity of liquid phase increases by the mixing of
 viscous oil. Even in the case of the immiscible
 combination, the oil droplet is so small that it mixes
 homogeneously in the liquid phase in the capillary tube and
 the refrigerant mass flow rate decreases by the mixing of
 immiscible oil. There is no significant influence of the
 oil concentration on the underpressure, which means
 pressure difference between saturation pressure and flash
 inception pressure, in both miscible and immiscible
 combinations.},

  Abstract                 = {Following licentiate thesis is a summary of the advances
 made within the research project - Micro- and nano
 structured surfaces for enhanced boiling heat transfer –
 which is a collaboration effort between the Divi-sion of
 Applied Thermodynamics and Refrigeration and the Division
 of Materials Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology
 (KTH).
 
 The main objectives with this research project has been to:
 develop methods for producing highly efficient boiling
 surfaces with well defined micro- and nano-structured
 porous surfaces by the use of micro- and nano-manufacturing
 techniques. This objective has been achieved and the result
 is a novel micro-porous surface structure comprising
 dendritically ordered nano-particles of cop-per. The
 structure was fabricated by a high-current-density
 electrode-position process, in which the evolution of
 hydrogen bubbles serve as a dynamic masking template to the
 growth of the dendritic copper struc-ture. Important
 variables were identified that affect the production of the
 structure and its features, such as surface orientation
 during electrode-position, pressure and temperature of
 electrolyte, and a final heat treat-ment of the surface
 under reduced atmosphere, all of which have previ-ously not
 been reported on.
 
 Experimental tests have been conducted in a widely used
 refrigerant, R134a, where the micro-porous structure was
 shown to enhance the boiling performance of a copper
 surface over 15 times compared to a regular copper surface.
 The boiling characteristics of the structure were found to
 be dependent on controllable surface characteristics. The
 re-markably good boiling performance of the novel
 micro-porous en-hancement structure has been attributed to
 its high porosity ( ~94%), a dendritically formed and
 exceptionally large surface area, and to a high density of
 well suited vapor escape channels (>50 per mm2).
 
 A patent application, intended to protect the enhancement
 structure and its fabrication method, was submitted to the
 Swedish patent authorities (PRV) on March 1st, 2006.},

  Abstract                 = {Presented research is an experimental study of the
 performance of a standard plate heat exchanger evaporator,
 both with and without a novel nano- and microporous copper
 structure, used to enhance the boiling heat transfer
 mechanism in the refrigerant channel. Various distance
 frames in the refrigerant channel were also employed to
 study the influence of the refrigerant mass flux on
 two-phase flow heat transfer. The tests were conducted at
 heat fluxes ranging between 4.5 kW/m2 and 17 kW/m2 with
 134a as refrigerant. Pool boiling tests of the enhancement
 structure, under similar conditions and at various surface
 inclination angles, were also performed for reasons of
 comparison. The plate heat exchanger with the enhancement
 structure displayed up to ten times enhanced heat transfer
 coefficient in the refrigerant channel, resulting in an
 improvement in the overall heat transfer coefficient with
 over 100%. This significant boiling enhancement is in
 agreement with previous pool boiling experiments and
 confirms that the enhancement structure may be used to
 enhance the performance of plate heat exchangers. A simple
 superposition model was used to evaluate the results, and
 it was found that, primarily, the convective boiling
 mechanism was affected by the distance frames in the
 standard heat exchanger. On the other hand, with the
 enhanced boiling structure, variations in hydraulic
 diameter in the refrigerant channel caused a significant
 change in the nucleate boiling mechanism, which accounted
 for the largest effect on the heat transfer performance.},

 heat pumps was presented based on fluid mechanics
 principle. And the minimum refrigerant velocity was
 calculated according to nil oil volumetric flow rate and
 the relation between refrigerant velocity and interface
 velocity. The design of diameter and length for U-tube

 main factors: oil return, pressure drop and heat transfer.
 On the basis of analysis of these factors, the model to
 deal with the fuzzy relation was established. With the
 model established, economical matching of the refrigeration
 system can be obtained. And it also will help for the

  Abstract                 = {The complexities of two-phase flow and evaporation on a
 tube bundle present important problems in the design of
 heat exchangers and the understanding of the physical
 phenomena taking place. The development of structured
 surfaces to enhance boiling heat transfer and thus reduce
 the size of evaporators adds another level of complexity to
 the modeling of such heat exchangers. Horizontal falling
 film evaporators have the potential to be widely used in
 large refrigeration systems and heat pumps, in the
 petrochemical industry and for sea water desalination
 units, but there is a need to improve the understanding of
 falling film evaporation mechanisms to provide accurate
 thermal design methods. The characterization of the effect
 of enhanced surfaces on the boiling phenomena occurring in
 falling film evaporators is thus expected to increase and
 optimize the performance of a tube bundle. In this work,
 the existing LTCM falling film facility was modified and
 instrumented to perform falling film evaporation
 measurements on single tube row and a small tube bundle.
 Four types of tubes were tested including: a plain tube, an
 enhanced condensing tube (Gewa-C+LW) and two enhanced
 boiling tubes (Turbo-EDE2 and Gewa-B4) to extend the
 existing database. The current investigation includes
 results for two refrigerants, R134a and R236fa, at a
 saturation temperature of Tsat = 5 °C, liquid film
 Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 3000, at heat fluxes
 between 20 and 60 kW/m2 in pool boiling and falling film
 configurations. Measurements of the local heat transfer
 coefficient were obtained and utilized to improve the
 current prediction methods. Finally, the understanding of
 the physical phenomena governing the falling film
 evaporation of liquid refrigerants has been improved.
 Furthermore, a method for predicting the onset of dry patch
 formation has been developed and a local heat transfer
 prediction method for falling film evaporation based on a
 large experimental database has been proposed. These
 represent significant improvements for the design of
 falling film evaporators.},

 microturbine unit consists of a compressor and a turbine

 Moreover there is a combustion chamber, a recuperator and a
 gas/water heat exchanger. A control system regulates the
 speed, the temperature and the electric power. To control
 the frequency, voltage and current of the outgoing power,
 the microturbine uses power electronics. The model is to be
 used in the research and development department at Turbec
 AB. Possible applications are in areas as control
 strategies, dynamic performance verification, operator
 training and control software/hardware verification. Since
 the potential applications are so different, the emphasis
 throughout the thesis has been on a general model that can
 be used in as many different operating ranges as possible.
 
 This should be done while retaining a high degree of
 accuracy at the most common scenario, running on full load.
 The emphasis has also been on the functionality and
 accuracy of the complete model over more detailed modelling
 of each component.
 
 In the thesis, the thermodynamic theory of each component
 is described and how it is modelled in Modelica. The
 microturbine model in the thesis covers the gas turbine
 unit, the control system and the mechanical part of the
 generator. The electric part of the generator and the power
 electronics are not included in the model, due to the
 limited time of the project. The thesis also discusses the
 well-known problems with modelling as e.g. discretisation
 and interpolation.
 
 The model uses components from the ThermoFluid library, the
 Modelica standard library and the Master’s thesis of
 Perez (2001). Static verification has been done with data
 from DSA, a steady state calculation program, which
 accurately represents the real microturbine. The Modelica
 model developed in the thesis has been found very accurate
 at the main operation range (100 kW down to 50 kW), with an
 average error of 0.6 % of the 13 most important
 thermodynamic variables at full load, 100 kW. Dynamic
 verification in three different scenarios has been done

 refrigerant was R 12, and the oil used was Shell Clavus 68.
 Efforts were made to model actual operation as closely as
 possible. It was found that the oil had a significant
 effect on the refrigerant flow and pressure drop.
 Measurements made on the heat transfer coefficient
 indicated that the oil had different effects depending on
 the fluid flow regime. For annular -- wavy regimes, there
 was no apparent effect, while for annular and film flows,
 the presence of oil significantly reduced the heat transfer
 coefficient. The dependence of heat transfer coefficient on
 refrigerant quality was also investigated and was found to
 be a maximum when the quality lay between 0.6 and 0.8. This
 regime corresponds to fully developed annular flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The development of an efficient isothermal
 turbine and compressor is essential for the realization of
 a small-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES). This
 article presents the theoretical development of an oil-free
 co-rotating scroll air compressor and turbine working with
 water injection to make the operations of expansion and
 compression as isothermal as possible. First experimental
 results in expander mode are shown. The theoretical
 performance is predicted with the help of a mathematical
 model using the equations of energy and mass conservation
 and the equation of state. This model takes into account
 the effects of water injection and volumetric losses. The
 experimental prototype is an oil-free scroll air compressor
 with the distinctive feature of having two mobile involutes
 working in synchronized co-rotation one relative to
 another. The prime-mover is an electric motor driving the
 two scrolls with two synchronizing belts. Water injection
 in the housing intends to provide a quasi-isothermal
 compression. The same device is used as an isothermal
 expander by supplying high-pressure air with water when it
 rotates backwards in expander mode, the electric motor
 acting then as a generator. Expected improvements to a
 standard scroll compressor and expander are a better
 volumetric efficiency and a greater power density due to a
 higher rotational speed of the scrolls, thanks to their
 symmetrical masses. The isothermal processes increase also
 the overall performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of the work presented in this thesis is to
 investigate the potential and prerequisites for improved
 energy efficiency of heat pump systems using efficient
 components and proper methods for optimisation of
 operation. The background is that several investigations
 have reported on possibilities for increased energy
 efficiency of heat pumps if variable-speed capacity control
 is used instead of conventional on/off control. Further
 improvements are possible if variable speed pumps or fans
 and electronically controlled expansion valves are used as
 well. To take full advantage of these new controls they
 should be properly co-ordinated and optimised. In this
 work, a measuring system consisting of three temperature
 sensors and two pressure sensors was used for on-line
 measurement of the coefficient of performance in an
 experimental investigation. Knowledge of the performance
 provides a basis for self-optimising closed-loop control.
 The measurement system can also be used for Fault Detection
 and Diagnosis (FDD) and Performance Indication and thus
 contribute to an integrated control system. The Nelder-Mead
 simplex method was applied for on-line optimisation. The
 method was evaluated by computer simulations and shows
 promising results. It was possible to find the optimal set
 point, maximising COP, and the method could also handle
 soft constraints, such as a desired set point for the
 heating capacity. The potential of variable-speed capacity
 control was investigated both by laboratory tests and
 annual energy savings calculations. The laboratory tests
 were made on a brine-to-water heat pump with a
 variable-speed piston compressor and an electronic
 expansion valve. The results from the tests showed a
 decrease in efficiency when applying variable-speed
 capacity control to the compressor when compared to
 conventional on/off control. Analyses indicate that this is
 due to losses in the frequency converter and increased
 losses within the compressor, most likely in the electric
 motor. The electronic valve gave only a marginal increase
 in efficiency compared to a conventional thermostatic
 expansion valve. Using these test results as a basis, the
 possible annual energy savings were calculated. This
 analysis indicates that there exists an energy saving
 potential also for variable-speed controlled brine-to-water
 heat pumps but it requires product development mainly of
 the compressors. A conservative estimate indicates savings
 of 10 % compared to on/off control.},

 steady-state models. Factors such as thermal inertia,
 different connection principles, temperature levels and lag
 times are also considered to see how they affect the
 comparison and the efficiency. The results show that
 performance of an intermittently controlled heat pump is
 reduced when using this dynamic model compared to the
 static models, whereas the results for a variable-speed
 controlled heat pump stay the same. introducing different
 controller dead bands, thermal inertias, etc. change the
 result only to a small extent. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and

 carrying the lubricating oil up in vertical sections of

 the thin oil layer over the inner surface of the riser due
 to gravity is to be balanced with the upward flow of the
 oil film due to the shear force created by the upward flow
 of the refrigerant vapor. Velocities are converted to
 refrigeration capacities by considering a saturated cycle
 between specified condenser and evaporator pressures.
 General relationships thus developed are enumerated for

  Abstract                 = {World energy crisis has triggered more attention to energy
 saving and energy conversion systems with high efficiency.
 There is a growing awareness that nanoscience and
 nanotechnology can have a profound impact on energy
 generation, conversion, and recovery. Nanotechnology-based
 solutions are being developed for a wide range of energy
 problems such as, solar electricity, hydrogen generation
 and storage, batteries, fuel cells, heat pumps and
 thermoelectrics. This thesis deals with the design and
 fabrication of novel functional materials/architectures for
 energy-related applications. The study includes two parts:
 Nanostructured thermoelectric (TE) materials for energy
 conversion and nanostructured metallic surfaces for energy
 heat transfer.
 
 In the first part, the focus is given to the fabrication of
 novel nanostructured TE materials and architectures. TE
 materials are very important functional materials that can
 convert heat to electrical energy and vice versa. Recently,
 nanostructuring TE materials showed very promising
 potential to improve their TE figure of merit which opens a
 new venue for the TE world. As a result, some advanced
 nanostructured TE architectures are proposed as the
 state-of-the-art TE materials/structures. Among these
 advanced TE architectures, bismuth telluride
 nanowires/thick films and skutterudite nanocomposites with
 nanoinclusions have been successfully fabricated and some
 of their advantageous TE performance has been demonstrated.
 For example, an improvement of 11% on the figure of merit,
 ZT, was achieved in the CoSb3 nanocomposite with 5 mole%
 ZrO2 as nanoinclusion. Comprehensive physico-chemical
 characterization techniques have been used for the
 synthesized TE materials. The potential-Seebeck microprobe,
 4-point probe and laser flash apparatus have been used for
 the measurement of TE parameters on the TE materials.
 
 In the second part of the thesis, we developed a
 nanostructured macro-porous (NMp) surface for enhancing
 heat transfer in boiling process. Enhanced surfaces for
 boiling improve the energy efficiency of heat pumping
 equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, etc.
 Conventional techniques currently used for fabricating
 enhanced surfaces are often based on the use of complicated
 mechanical machine tools and require a large consumption of
 materials and give only limited enhancement of the boiling
 heat transfer. In this thesis, we present a new approach to
 fabricate enhanced surfaces by using electrodeposition
 under specific conditions forming in-situ dynamic gas
 bubble templates. As a result, the NMp metallic surface
 layer comprising of dendritically ordered copper branches
 is obtained. Since the structure is formed during the
 evolution of the dynamic bubbles, it is ideal for the
 bubble generation applications such as boiling. The
 efficiency of the NMp surfaces for boiling heat transfer
 was evaluated in pool boiling experiments. At the heat flux
 of 1 W/cm2, the heat transfer coefficient for the NMp
 surface is found to be more than 17 times higher than the
 reference surface. It's estimated that such an effective
 boiling surface would improve the energy efficiency of many
 heat pumping machines with 10 - 30 %. The extraordinary
 enhancement of boiling performance is explained by the
 structure characteristics, which assist in enhancing
 nucleation of the gas bubbles, subsequent coalescence, and
 facilitated departure from the surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel model depicting mass flow characteristics of
 electronic expansion valves (EEVs) is developed based on
 Bernoulli equation. Different from some conventional models
 using the two-phase outlet pressure and corrected flow
 coefficient, the new model considers metastable phenomenon
 caused by rapid depressurization and employs the pressure
 at throat of EEVs and the single-phase incompressible flow
 coefficient. Based on experimental data, a set of empirical
 correlations for the pressure calculation are developed for
 R22 and its substitutes, R407C and R410A. The relative
 deviations of mass flow rate predicted by the present model
 to the measured data are ranged from -6.12% to +7.50% for
 R22, and from -9.56% to +9.94% for R410A, and from -13.19%
 to +16.75% for R407C. The theoretical analyses and
 predicting results for flow characteristics of EEVs show
 that the new model is better than other conventional
 models.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A hybrid on-chip two-phase cooling cycle
 specifically designed to cool server boards with chips of
 high performance computers was experimentally evaluated
 considering steady-state and transient operation of two
 parallel pseudo-chips and auxiliary electronics mimicking a
 real server board. Control strategies were developed and
 evaluated by reference tracking and disturbance rejection
 tests considering several setpoints of controlled
 variables. The hybrid cycle, operating with a common
 refrigerant \{R134a\} as the working fluid, was
 energetically and exergetically compared with two other
 cooling cycles experimentally evaluated in a previous
 study, one driven by an oil-free gear pump and another by
 an oil-free mini-compressor. The results showed that, for a
 specific steady state condition and heat load, respectively
 28.9%, 51.9% and 62.5% of the energy out of the pump,
 compressor and hybrid cycles were associated with heat
 losses. The differences observed between the three cycles
 were justified firstly due to the concept of the cycles,
 i.e. cycles with the compressor showed as expected lower
 thermal performance than that with pump since its appeal is
 for energy recovery (benefitting from a higher condensing
 temperature) and secondly due to the irreversibilities
 observed in drivers, condenser and piping (thermal
 insulation). In summary, the three cycles proved to be
 efficient, simple and reliable concepts to cool server
 boards (CPUs, \{DIMMs\} etc.), showing high thermal
 performance and potential for heat recovery when compared
 with traditional air-cooling systems in current use in data
 centers. It can also be said that the pump cycle showed the
 best results in terms of energy and exergy, with the
 cooling and heat recovery performances reaching a maximum
 of about 5 and 1.8 times higher than the other cycles
 (worth noting that the focus in the present study was
 two-phase flow control and proof-of-concept of different
 cooling loops, meaning that no ���optimal���
 system design was attempted and the differences above can
 be reduced). },

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this work is to extend the investigation, to
 the influence of lubricating oil on R22-oil mixture in the
 heat pump and refrigeration system. The refrigerant-oil
 test bed was modified to accommodate R22-oil mixture
 investigation and R22-oil solubility equation was
 developed. The influence of oil on evaporator heat transfer
 coefficient,refrigerant and water side heat, pressure drop
 and evaporator coefficient of performance was investigated.
 The results of this work show that, evaporator performance
 degraded or upgraded depending on the oil concentration and
 evaporator outlet temperature.The study of the evaporator
 heat pick up data shows that the addition of different
 percentages of oil at various evaporating temperature
 resultls in reduction of heat pick up by the evaporator and
 this is pronounced at higher oil fraction and lower
 evaporating temperature. It is concluded that, combination
 of oil fraction and the evaporator outlet temperature are
 two dominant factors in degrading the evaporator
 performance. The evaporator performs less well at high oil
 fraction and low evaporator outlet temperature.
 Furthermore,introduction of oil into the evaporator had an
 effect on the two phase flow pattern inside the evaporator
 and the region of two phase flow extended to the entire
 evaporator tubes.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study explores the potential of using
 visualization techniques to investigate refrigerant/oil
 flow through adiabatic capillary tubes. A literature review
 shows that these techniques have been used before for
 capillary tube investigations, but none of these studies
 focused on the refrigerant/oil phenomena. Therefore, the
 main objective is to investigate the flow of a
 refrigerant/oil mixture through a glass capillary tube,
 with special emphasis on the behavior of the vaporization
 point. The test fluids are R-404A (a near azeotropic blend)
 and a polyolester-type oil. Experimental data cover oil
 concentrations ranging from 5.6 to 6.9% (by mass), degrees
 of subcooling ranging from 6.2 to 21.5��C (11.2 F to
 38.7 F), and a condensing pressure of 1825 kPa (250 psig).
 The results show trends of mass flow rate, and give some
 useful insights about the location of the vaporization
 point for various oil concentrations and operating
 conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel neural network (NN) to control
 an ammonia refrigerant evaporator. Inspired by the latest
 findings on the biological neuron, a dynamic synaptic unit
 (DSU) is proposed to enhance the information processing
 capacity of artificial neurons. Treating the dynamic
 synaptic activity after the nonlinear somatic activity
 helps to capture the dynamics demarcated by the Gaussian
 activation pertaining to the input space. This practice
 leads to a remarkable reduction in curse of dimensionality.
 The proposed \{NN\} architecture has been compared with two
 other conventional architectures; one with dynamic neural
 units (DNUs) and the other with nonlinear static functions
 as perceptrons. The objective is to control evaporator heat
 flow rate and secondary fluid outlet temperature while
 keeping the degree of refrigerant superheat in the range
 4���7 K at the evaporator outlet by manipulating
 refrigerant and evaporator secondary fluid flow rates. The
 drawbacks of conventional approaches to this problem are
 discussed, and how the novel method can overcome them are
 presented. An evolutionary approach is adopted to optimize
 the parameters of the \{NN\} controllers. Then evaporator
 process model is accomplished as a combination of governing
 equations and a sub \{NN\} resulting in a simple and
 sufficiently accurate model. The effectiveness of the
 proposed dynamic \{NN\} controller for the evaporator
 system model is validated using experimental data from the
 ammonia refrigeration plant. },

 At high vapor qulities (x > 0.75-0.85), the local boiling
 heat transfer coefficients dropped off rapidly with
 increasing oil concentration. At low to intermediate vapor
 qualities (0.2 < x < 0.60), oil tended to increase the
 local boiling coefficient at 300 kg/m2s (220500 lb/h ft2)
 while significant deterioration in boiling performance
 occured at the lower two mass velocities. Ther was strong
 evidence that oil holdup occurred inside the microfin tube
 test section and was responsible for the sharp falloff in
 performance at the mass velocity of 100kg/m2s (73500 lb/h

  Abstract                 = {Concern for the environmental effects of HFC-refrigerants
 as well as the use of flammable refrigerants has resulted
 in a need of decreasing the refrigerant charge in
 refrigeration and heat pump systems. This paper discusses
 the possibility of such reductions, both at the systems-
 and the component level. It is shown that a move towards
 indirect systems, using secondary refrigerants, on both the
 cold and the hot side of the system may result in
 considerable reduction of charge. However, this reduction
 may come at the cost of slightly reduced system
 performance, which in itself is detrimental from an
 environmental point of view. At the component level, it may
 be shown that the main contents of refrigerant is usually
 contained in the heat exchangers. By selecting compact
 designs the charge may be reduced to extremely low levels.
 Specifically, mini-channel heat exchangers can be used for
 reaching low charge. With proper selection of heat
 exchangers, the system performance should not be influenced
 by the reduction of charge. For indirect systems, the
 amount of refrigerant solved in the compressor oil may be
 comparable to the amount in the (compact) heat exchangers.
 A possible solution to reduce this amount is to use
 compressors with less oil. With components selected for
 minimum charge, the system design may be different than
 what is usual. Instead of a high pressure receiver and a
 thermostatic expansion valve, a capillary tube may be used
 in combination with a minimal low pressure receiver,
 similar to the system design used in household
 refrigerators.},

 were compared with those of R22 at the same test
 conditions. Based on the experimental data, an empirical
 correlation for mass flow predictions in EEVs was developed
 by modifying the orifice equation. The predictions of the
 present correlation showed good agreement with the measured

  Abstract                 = {For some years, European regulation concerning
 refrigerating systems has become more and more severe.
 Because of their design and technology, refrigeration units
 cannot avoid refrigerant leaks, and can thus have a harmful
 impact on the environment. Many studies aimed at minimizing
 the charge in a refrigerating machine were thus developed.
 On a global level, reduction of refrigerant charges must
 not affect energy aspects while respecting environmental
 constraints [Montreal 1987, Kyoto 1997]. The architecture
 and refrigerant charge distribution in the systems are of
 particular importance; their analyses permit the
 determination of the target elements and thus define those
 in which the refrigerant charge could be reduced (heat
 exchangers, liquid pipes, receivers, ���). This paper
 presents a review of the refrigerant charge studies in a
 refrigerating plant (methodologies of charge measurement,
 void fraction correlations and characteristic values for
 various technologies). It also evaluates the influence of
 the refrigerant charge on the coefficient of performance
 (COP) and on the cooling capacity. Finally, it inventories
 the different means that allow the charge in a
 refrigerating system to be minimized. },

 mineral oil ISO VG10-refrigerant R12 mixture flow with foam
 formation in a straight horizontal 3.22 mm ID, 6.0 m long
 tube. An experimental apparatus was designed to allow the
 measurement of both pressure and temperature profiles along
 the tube as well as the visualization of the flow patterns.
 Tests were performed at different mass flow rates, several
 refrigerant mass fractions at the inlet of the flow, and
 inlet mixture temperatures around 29.0°C. At the inlet of
 the tube a liquid mixture flow was visualized. In this
 region, both temperature and pressure gradient were
 constant. As the flow proceeded towards the exit of the
 tube the pressure drop produced a reduction of the
 refrigerant solubility in the oil yielding to the formation
 of the first bubbles. Initially, small and few bubbles
 could be noticed and the flow behaved as a bubbly flow.
 Eventually, the bubble population increased and foam flow
 pattern was observed at the exit of the tube. Due to the
 large formation of bubbles, both the temperature and the
 pressure of the mixture were substantially reduced in this
 region. Visualization results also showed that both flow
 regimes (bubbly and foam) were intermittent. Copyright ©

  Abstract                 = {Currently, the different pollutant emissions caused by the
 use of fossil energies are an increasingly important
 concern and numerous studies aim at developing
 technological solutions allowing the progressive
 replacement of the fossil energies by more sustainable and
 less harmful energy sources. In the context of heating for
 domestic applications, the prospective substitution of gas
 or fuel oil boilers by electrical heat pumps is typically a
 part of this problematic. This Ph.D thesis participates, in
 the frame of an industrial partnership, in the development
 of a high performance domestic heat pump through the study
 of the control circuits of the high speed electrical drive,
 mandatory for such heating systems. In order to generalize
 the presented work, this study is completed by
 considerations about high speed drives tailored for
 generation. The differences and similitudes between motor
 and generator modes are presented in the whole document.
 The first part of this document is constituted of an
 introductory chapter allowing to place this study in its
 context and to define the main concepts and hypothesis used
 all along this document. The second part of this document,
 formed by two chapters, is dedicated to the study of the
 structure of the power electronics. Chapter 2 covers the
 systematic choice of a topology and its specific command
 strategy for the implementation of the machine interface
 stage. Two commonly encountered solutions are compared
 regarding their adequacy with a previously defined optimal
 command criterion. Chapter 3 is dedicated to the study of
 the intermediate DC/DC converter. Based on the Energetic
 Macroscopic Representation, a formal study is conducted in
 order to show that the use of a multilevel topology can
 lead to increasing the whole drive performance and
 decreasing the power electronics circuits size. The control
 aspects are covered in the third part of this thesis. In
 chapter 4, a survey of sensorless technics is presented.
 The specific features of some sensorless technics are
 discussed regarding their adequacy with the consequences of
 the choice of the machine interface state topology and
 command strategy. Chapter 5 is dedicated to control
 strategies allowing to regulate the speed in the case of a
 motor mode and the torque in a generator mode. The two last
 parts of this document conclude it. The fourth part,
 constituted of chapter 6, presents the experimental
 validations of the various theoretical results described
 all along the document. The last chapter is the final
 conclusion of this work. The conducted work is summarized,
 the main results are described, and the perspectives for
 future works are given.},

  Abstract                 = {Heating and cooling will more and more rely on heat
 pumping in order to enable a more rational use of energy.
 The further development of domestic and small industrial
 multi-stage heat pumps with enhanced performance is
 impaired by the presence of oil mixed with the refrigerant
 and its migration through the hermetic loop. Oil-free
 directly driven small-scale turbomachinery has been
 identified as a technology that will allow a significant
 performance surge in refrigeration and heat pump
 applications. A proof of concept compressor unit has been
 designed, built and successfully tested, demonstrating the
 technical feasibility of such a system. Directly driven
 turbocompressors are composed of several components,
 involving different specialization fields like compressor
 aerodynamics, bearing and rotordynamic design as well as
 the electric layout of the motor and its drive.
 Fragmentation is the commonly used procedure for designing
 complex and interdisciplinary systems. The splitting into
 submodules certainly simplifies the design process of the
 individual components, it leads, however, to conservative
 designs and makes it more complex to keep track of the
 mutual interactions between the submodules. Only an
 integrated and simultaneous design of the complete system
 ensures an optimum solution. The models of the different
 components have been linked together to build a global
 system, enabling its integrated optimization. Compared to a
 unit that has been designed using fragmented design, the
 overall efficiency could be increased by 16 points by using
 the proposed integrated design procedure. In order to be
 able to predict the system's performance, losses, critical
 speeds and stability margins the different components have
 been modeled in a modular and generic way. As the system
 operates with a vapor close to the saturation line, both
 the impeller and the gas-bearing models include real gas
 effects. The bearing model additionally incorporates
 rarefaction and clearance distortion effects resulting from
 centrifugal growth and thermal influence. Models for
 calculating the windage losses occurring in the bearings
 and in the gap between the rotor and the stator of the
 electric motor have been introduced as well. In order to
 enable the calculation of the whirl speeds and the
 corresponding stability margins, a rotordynamic model has
 been developed specifically for gas bearing supported
 rotors. The model has been extended with a forced response
 module that allows to predict the orbits of the rotor as a
 function of a given unbalance and vice-versa. A vapor phase
 test rig for measuring the compressor performance has been
 built. The oil free gas bearing supported radial
 turbocompressor with a tip diameter of 20 mm could be
 tested to speeds up to 210 krpm, reaching pressure ratios
 higher than 3.2 and powers of 1.7 kW. Internal isentropic
 compressor efficiencies in excess of 80% have been
 measured. A detailed comparison between the measured and
 the predicted compressor map shows excellent agreement.},

  Review                   = {The primary objective for a retrofit heat pump is to
 produce heating water at 60 C (with at least 10 C
 tem-perature rise) with an external air temperature of -12
 C and a heating supply of a minimum of 10 kW. This would
 enable the heat pump to replace oil or gas boilers. To
 enable such a heat pump a two-stage com-pressor is the most
 promising technical solution. The final goal is the
 development and the analysis of a twin stage radial
 compressor on gas bearings for application in high
 temperature heatpumps. The application of gas-lubricated
 bearings avoids the need for lubrication. In November 2001
 the feasibility of such a unit has been analysed and
 calculated. Now the aim is to build and test a first single
 stage compressor as a proof of concept. This work has been
 performed at the Industrial Energy Laboratory (LENI) of the
 EPFL in Lausanne and was sponsored by the Swiss Federal
 Office of Energy. The compressor development is subdivided
 into 4 parts: bearing unit, motor and drive, design of
 impeller and design of the complete unit. The report
 describes the detailed design procedure and the results of
 the first tests. After a first bearing touchdown a "Step by
 Step" procedure has been implemented. Several test rigs
 have allowed testing the bearing unit and the motor
 separately. The bearing unit has been run to speeds up to
 150'000 rpm with an air turbine. Driving with the motor has
 revealed to be trickier; the first motor has not allowed
 the bearings to run properly at low speeds. Only the second
 motor has worked well to speeds up to 104'000 rpm where the
 bearings have touched down and have been destroyed. As
 there are no more bearing units at disposition the tests
 had to be stopped. The project shall be finished in
 cooperation with an industrial partner.},

  Abstract                 = {Le but de cette première phase du projet est d?étudier
 la faisabilité d'un compresseur radial, bi-étagé, sans
 huile pour des pompes à chaleur retrofit pour des
 applications domestiques. Ce rapport décrit le travail
 effectué par OFTTech SA en collaboration avec le
 Laboratoire d'énergétique industrielle (LENI) de l'EPFL.
 L'objectif d'une pompe à chaleur retrofit est de pouvoir
 produire de l?eau chaude à 60°C avec une élévation de
 température de 10 K pour une température extérieure de
 -12_C. Sa source froide est l?air extérieur. Au point
 A-12W60 elle doit fournir une puissance de chauffage de 10
 kW au moins. Ces caractéristiques sont nécessaires pour
 remplacer des chaudières à mazout et à gaz.Pour
 atteindre des coefficients de performance acceptables pour
 concurrencer les chaudières conventionnelles un cycle
 bi-étagé représente la solution technique la plus
 avancée en ce moment. Ce rapport démontre qu'un
 turbocompresseur tournant à vitesse variable (jusqu?à
 240'000 t/min), peut conduire à une solution unique avec
 des performances plus élevées que celles des meilleures
 solutions existantes sur le marché actuel. Cela est
 possible en utilisant des paliers lubrifiés avec du
 réfrigérant enphase gazeuse qui permettent d?exclure de
 l?huile dans la boucle de réfrigération. Les paliers à
 gaz utilisés ont des jeux radiaux de l'ordre de 5 à 10
 micromètres. Par conséquent les tolérances de
 fabrication des paliers sont de l'ordre du micromètre pour
 des productions en grosse série.Plusieurs réfrigérants
 ont été pris en considération. Le R134a a été choisi
 pour cette étude. Le travail effectué par ABB a
 démontré la faisabilité de compresseurs radiaux de moins
 de 20 mm de diamètre présentant des efficacités entre 60
 et 80%. Le compresseur, entraîné par moteur électrique
 ne sera pas plus long que 100 mm le rendant ainsi plus
 petit, plus léger et moins cher que les solutions
 existantes. La conclusion principale du projet est que la
 performance globale comparée aux solutions existantes
 résulte en une réduction de la consommation d?énergie
 électrique de près de 20% et qu?un tel turbocompresseur
 était faisable techniquement et aussi économiquement. Par
 ailleurs la caractéristique est plus compatible avec la
 demande.Cette première phase du projet a été financé
 par l?OFEN (Office fédéral de l?énergie) et par le PSEL
 (Fonds pour projets et études de l'économie
 électrique).},

 for boiling temperatures between -28.6 and +20.1A degrees

 the sandblasted tube and the SE55 oil the heat transfer
 coefficients for the refrigerant/oil-mixture can be higher
 or lower than those for the pure refrigerant, depending on
 oil mass fraction, boiling temperature and heat flux. In
 some cases the highest heat transfer coefficients were
 obtained at a mass fraction of 3\%. For the 170 cSt oil
 there is a clear decrease in heat transfer for all
 variations except for a heat flux 4,000 W/m(2) and -10.1A
 degrees C at 0.5\% oil content. The heat transfer
 coefficients are compared to those in the literature for a
 smooth stainless steel tube and a platinum wire. For the
 enhanced tube and 55 cSt oil the heat transfer coefficients
 are clearly below those for pure refrigerant in all cases.
 The experimental results for the sandblasted tube are
 compared with the correlation by Jensen and Jackman. The
 calculated values are within +20 and -40\% for the medium
 viscosity oil and between +50\% and -40\% for the high
 viscosity oil. A correlation for predicting oil-degradation
 effects on enhanced surfaces does not exist.},

  Abstract                 = {A good adaptation of refrigerating machine components
 operating with a variable-speed compressor requires
 knowledge of the dynamic behaviour of each component, more
 particularly of the expansion valve. The behaviour of
 various thermostatic expansion valves (ballast charge,
 adsorbent charge and maximum operating pressure or MOP
 charge) has been studied for compressor speed variations
 (between 20% and 200%) of a refrigerating machine, with R22
 as refrigerant, and a cooling capacity of 6kW. This study
 has shown the disadvantages of these expansion valves,
 during dynamic operation, without modification of the
 static superheat. The decrease of the evaporating pressure,
 consecutive to a step or a ramp of the compressor speed,
 can lead to the suction of a two-phase fluid in the
 compressor. This phenomenon takes place particularly either
 for the low evaporating temperatures or for great
 variations of the compressor speed, more than 50%. The
 stable operating limits of different thermostatic expansion
 valves have been determined as a function of the
 evaporation temperature and the rotational speed of the
 compressor during the non-steady state.

 nécessite de connaître le comportement dynamique de

 a permis de mettre en évidence les inconvénients des
 détendeurs testés lorsqu'ils fonctionnent en régime
 variable sans modification de la surchauffe statique. La
 décroissance de la pression d'évaporation, consécutive
 au déclenchement d'un échelon ou d'une rampe de vitesse
 de rotation, peut conduire à l'aspiration par le
 compresseur d'un fluide diphasique. Ce phénomène se
 produit plus particulièrement, soit dans le cas de faibles
 températures d'évaporation, soit pour des variations de
 vitesse supérieures à 50%. En régime dynamique, les
 limites de fonctionnement stable des différents
 détendeurs thermostatiques ont été déterminées en

  Abstract                 = {The complexity of two-phase flow boiling on a tube bundle
 presents many challenges to the understanding of the
 physical phenomena taking place. It is important to
 quantify these numerous heat flow mechanisms in order to
 better describe the performance of tube bundles as a
 function of the operational conditions. In the present
 study, the bundle boiling facility at the Laboratory of
 Heat and Mass Transfer (LTCM) was modified to obtain
 high-speed videos to characterise the two-phase regimes and
 some bubble dynamics of the boiling process. It was then
 used to measure heat transfer on single tubes and in bundle
 boiling conditions. Pressure drop measurements were also
 made during adiabatic and diabatic bundle conditions. New
 enhanced boiling tubes from Wolverine Tube Inc. (Turbo-B5)
 and the Wieland-Werke AG (Gewa-B5) were investigated using
 R134a and R236fa as test fluids. The tests were carried out
 at saturation temperatures Tsat of 5°C and 15°C, mass
 flow rates from 4 to 35 kg/m2s and heat fluxes from 15 to
 70 kW/m2, typical of actual operating conditions. The flow
 pattern investigation was conducted using visual
 observations from a borescope inserted in the middle of the
 bundle. Measurements of the light attenuation of a laser
 beam through the intertube two-phase flow and local
 pressure fluctuations with piezo-electric pressure
 transducers were also taken to further help in
 characterising the complex flow. Pressure drop measurements
 and data reduction procedures were revised and used to
 develop new, improved frictional pressure drop prediction
 methods for adiabatic and diabatic two-phase conditions.
 The physical phenomena governing the enhanced tube
 evaporation process and their effects on the performance of
 tube bundles were investigated and insight gained. A new
 method based on a theoretical analysis of thin film
 evaporation was used to propose a new correlating
 parameter. A large new database of local heat transfer
 coefficients were obtained and then utilised to generate
 improved prediction methods for pool boiling and bundle
 boiling, including a method for predicting the onset of
 dryout.},

 refrigerant/oil mixture is R134a/PAG oil which are totally
 miscible, but could be any air conditioning
 refrigerant/oil, including carbon dioxide (CO2)/oil. The
 model accounts for all major effects inside the
 accumulator, such as friction, bends, sudden expansion,
 sudden contraction and heat exchange. The outputs are vapor
 quality, pressure and temperature at various positions of
 accumulator. In order to verify the mathematical model,
 experiments are performed in an experimental setup made up
 of real size automotive air conditioning components. The
 simulated results agree well with the experimental data.
 The simulation and experimental results show an important
 function of accumulators that is to determine the vapor
 quality into compressor, and thus has influence on the
 performance of whole automotive A/C systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A lubrication agent is necessary in almost all the
 refrigeration vapour compression systems, particularly for
 the correct operation of the compressor. However, a certain
 portion of the oil always circulates with the refrigerant
 through the cycle. This circulation is at the origin of a
 deviation from the theoretical behaviour (i.e. based on
 pure refrigerant) of the components. This article aims at
 reviewing the oil-related researches in the field of
 refrigeration. Previous reviews in the literature focused
 on the thermo-hydraulic consequences of the presence of
 oil; we will analyse here its thermodynamical consequences.
 In a first part, a brief literature review will give an
 overview of current scientific and technological issues
 concerning the impact of oil on components or on whole
 refrigeration systems. The typical approaches and methods
 employed to address this problem will be described. These
 researches require sound tools for the evaluation of
 thermodynamic properties of refrigerant-oil mixtures. The
 second part of this article is hence a critical review of
 these tools, and focuses particularly on liquid-vapour
 equilibrium, absorption-diffusion, and mixture enthalpy
 calculation.},

 different oil circulating mass fractions. This presentation
 allows the calculation of the enthalpy change through an
 evaporator, with and without taking into account the effect
 of oil, and the prediction of the non evaporated quantity
 of refrigerant at the compressor suction. The results of
 the model for two pairs of R407C/POE oil of different
 solubilities show that under the same working conditions,
 the solubility of the refrigerant in oil can have a
 considerable effect on the evaporator performances. Indeed,
 for two oils presenting the same viscosity grade, the
 evaporator performances decrease when the refrigerant-oil
 solubility increases.},

 Les concepts les plus prometteurs parmi les

 biétagées ont été étudiées et testées sur des
 machines prototypes en laboratoire [1,2,3].L'expérience a
 montré que la mise en oeuvre des concepts biétagés
 classiques souffre du problème potentiel de défauts de
 lubrification des compresseurs causé par la migration
 d'huile à travers le système. En plus cette huile
 provoque une baisse des performances du cycle [4], ceci
 surtout au niveau du transfert de chaleur
 dansl'évaporateur.L'analyse approfondie de la migration
 d?huile dans les pompes à chaleur air-eau mono- et

 spectromètre infrarouge ainsi que la proposition de
 concepts stables pour la lubrification des

  Abstract                 = {A new type of air-water heat pump has been developed with
 the aim to cover an extended application range in high
 temperature residential heating (for retrofitting existing
 oil or gas boilers in hydronic heating systems). The base
 heat output is about 10 kWth. Based on a commercial heat
 pump, the refrigerant cycle was modified with two main
 components: A hermetic scroll compressor with a specially
 designed vapor injection port and an internal
 “economizer” heat exchanger. Performance tests were
 carried out in the laboratory over a wide range of
 injection mass flow rates and at external conditions
 covering air temperatures down to -12°C. At A-7°C/W60°C
 an increase of heat output of 28% and a COP improvement of
 15% compared to the tests without injection flow have been
 observed. The heat output at A2° C/W50°C (standard
 operating conditions without injection) and at A-12°
 C/W65°C (extreme heating point with injection) are about
 the same. Considering these promising results and with the
 aim to further improve the seasonal COP and the heat output
 curve, a second compressor prototype based on a different
 compressor model, is being tested in phase two of this
 project.},

  Abstract                 = {n this report different air-water heat pump cycles under
 the operating conditions of the retrofit market and in the
 low heating power range are examined. The already existing
 heat pump models show excessive power and efficiency loss
 at very low ambient temperatures. Due to the variations of
 the source temperatures the heat pump system has to be
 improved over a relatively wide application range. The
 existing perfomances are insufficient and new solutions
 have to be found. The introduction of a supplementary
 compressor, as well as the efficient use of the liquid
 subcooling are two examples, which will determine the
 selection of the cycles (see pages 4 - 7). By simulation of
 the suggested cycles, like the heat pump with the auxiliary
 liquid subcooling cycle, as well as the two stage cycles
 (with intermediate expansion or intermediate injection) it
 can be shown that these cylces operate with an improved
 seasonal coefficient of performance up to 10% - 15% (see
 table 4.4). Heat pump cycles with more than one compressor
 permit a better adjustment of the heat output. The seasonal
 coefficient of performance of these heat pump cycles is
 calculated with the temperature distribution of the climate
 in Zurich and a given heat curve. The cycle components are
 simulated on a purely theoretical base, with the exception
 of the compressors characteristics and inlcuding the real
 heat output from the heat pump. The cycles are calculated
 with pure refrigerant and with zeotropic mixtures. The
 results with propane show equivalent seasonal coefficients
 of performance on all suggested cycles. The heat pump cycle
 with liquid subcooling shows good performance in the middle
 range of the air temperatures. The main compressor will
 then work at its best conditions. At low external
 temperatures the two-stage cycles with two serial connected
 compressors, show very good performance. And at low
 temperature differences between the air and the heating
 water single-stage heat pump are the best with the actual
 compressor types. With zeotropic refrigerant mixtures
 (R407C, R290/R600a), the advantages of the proposed cycle
 with liquid subcooling in the condensing part are not
 significant and the losses, due to the low performance of
 the auxiliar compressor. will lower the coefficient of
 performance under the level of the other two-stage cycles
 (see table 4.3). The simulation results show that several
 solutions can be considered for this application. An
 evaluation of the costs and the resulting technical
 problems can only be mentioned at this time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper shows an implementation of a scroll booster
 compressor mounted at the suction line of a single-stage
 air-water heat pump. The compressor selected to be used
 as booster is a beltdriven scroll compressor initially
 dedicated to automotive refrigeration. For the tests
 reported here, it is driven by an electrical motor and
 has been modified to obtain a lower built-in volume
 ratio. The computations for those modifications have been
 made with our own software called GeoScroll. Tests of the
 heat pump at A-11/W65 show a large improvement of the
 heat output, which is doubled (raising from 7.39 kW, in
 the normal single-stage configuration, up to 15.7 kW)
 while the COP decreases by less than 10\% (from 2.08 to
 1.89). This performance degradation is not due to bad
 performances of the booster compressor, that are at the
 level expected, but to a decrease of the evaporation
 pressure (1 bar, which is equivalent to 11 K), as the
 evaporator has not been designed for such heating powers.
 Even with working conditions outside its design range,
 the heat pump behavior with the booster has been proved
 to be very stable (the experiments were performed over
 few weeks). Furthermore, no oil accumulation has been
 noticed in the booster compressor, which is favorable to
 an integration of the device into existing heat pumps,
 currently in service. Indeed, it can be easily included
 into existing single-stage heat pumps with few
 adaptations. The concept is attractive in comparison to
 backup with heating devices, used in case of low
 temperatures, with a far better exergy efficiency and
 with contribution to the reduction of the electric demand
 peak.},

 mixed with a lubricating oil are reported. The tests were
 run at a nominal inlet pressure of 3.4 bar over a wide
 range of vapor qualities at mass velocities of 100, 200 and
 300 kg/m2s (73500, 147000 and 220500 lb/h ft2) for inlet
 oil concentrations from 0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 5.0 wt.% oil.
 At high vapor qulities (x > 0.75-0.85), the local boiling
 heat transfer coefficients dropped off rapidly with
 increasing oil concentration. At low to intermediate vapor
 qualities (0.2 < x < 0.60), oil tended to increase the
 local boiling coefficient at 300 kg/m2s (220500 lb/h ft2)
 while significant deterioration in boiling performance
 occured at the lower two mass velocities. Ther was strong
 evidence that oil holdup occurred inside the microfin tube
 test section and was responsible for the sharp falloff in
 performance at the mass velocity of 100kg/m2s (73500 lb/h
 ft2), which means there may be a lower mass velocity limit

  Abstract                 = {The latest research in mesoscale drive systems is
 targeting rotational speeds toward 1 million r/min for a
 power range of 1-1 kW. Emerging applications for megaspeed
 drives (MegaNdrives) are to be found in future turbo
 compressor systems for fuel cells and heat pumps,
 generators/starters for portable nanoscale gas turbines,
 printed circuit board drilling and machining spindles, and
 electric power generation from pressurized gas flow. The
 selection of the machine type and the challenges involved
 in designing a machine for megaspeed operation such as the
 winding concepts, a mechanical rotor design capable of 1
 000 000 r/min, the selection of magnetic materials for the
 stator, and the optimization concerning high-frequency
 losses and torque density are presented. Furthermore, a
 review of the advantageous inverter topologies, taking into
 account the extremely low stator inductance and possible
 high-speed bearing types such as ball bearings, air
 bearings, foil bearings, and magnetic bearings, are given.
 Finally, prototypes and experimental results originating
 from MegaNdrive research at Swiss Federal Institute of
 Technology Zurich are discussed and extreme temperature
 operation and power microelectricalmechanical system are
 identified as targets for future research.},
